What's this about?
------------------

vdr-checkts parses VDR recordings (only TS-recordings / vdr 1.7.x) and
records any discontinuities in the transport stream by checking the
continuity counter.

Ideally there will be no discontinuities and vdr-checkts returns with
exit code 0. If continuity errors were found it returns with exit code 1
and prints the number of errors.


How to use?
-----------

Usage: vdr-checkts [OPTIONS] RECORDING_DIR

  -m errors, --max-errors=ERROR Stop scanning if error count reaches ERROR
  -h,        --help             print this help and exit


What else?
----------

I've also include a patch for VDR 1.7.21 which will make VDR check for
continuity errors while recording.

The number of continuity errors is written to the info file in the field
tagged with 'R'.
